# pb

Improved pbcopy/pbpaste for OSX

The standard pbcopy and pbpaste utilities can manipulate the plaintext clipboard
but have no easy way of accessing the HTML pasteboard.  This module and CLI tool
provide a more convenient way to access the pasteboard from node.

## Installation

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pb), global installation is easiest:

    $ npm install -g pb

Depending on your system configuration, you may need to run as root:

    $ sudo npm install -g pb

## Command-Line Tool Usage

To get data from a specific pasteboard:

    $ pb [type]
    $ pb -m <type>

To set a specific pasteboard, be sure to pipe data into pb:

    $ get_data | pb -s [type]

To list available pasteboards:

    $ pb -l

For example, to grab the contents of the HTML pasteboard and put it on the
plaintext pasteboard:

    $ pb -m html | pb -s

## Library Usage

From node, `pb` exposes:

- `get(type)`: get pasteboard data from specified pasteboard
- `set(type, data)`: set pasteboard data (overwrites other pasteboards)
- `gettypes()`: enumerate available pasteboards

For example, to grab the contents of the HTML pasteboard and put it on the
plaintext pasteboard:

```
var pb = require('pb');
var HTMLOutput = pb.get('html');
var textOutput = pb.get();
```

## Supported Pasteboards

- `NSStringPboardType` (plaintext)
- `NSHTMLPboardType` (HTML)
